# Driver-Drowsiness-Alert-System
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is designed to detect signs of drowsiness in drivers and prevent accidents by issuing an alert when the driver is detected to be drowsy. The system analyzes a video stream from a camera, detecting closed eyes and other signs of drowsiness. Upon detection, an audio alarm is triggered to wake the driver up.
